# Horiseon

## This Challenge repository contains the following:

> * A refactored Horiseon website which makes use of semantic elements, rather than non-semantic elements, that clearly describe their content to both the browswer and other developers.
>
> * The HTML elements also follow a structure that is logical separate of independent styling and positioning.
>
> * Accessible alt attributes that will enable screen readers to read the information about all of the images on the page. In this instance, null attributes were used because the images are purely decorative and provide no additional value to the page. 
>
> * Heading attributes that are written in sequential order.
>
> * A title element that has a concise and descriptive title.
